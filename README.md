# Algorithm-Visualizer

Developed an interactive web application to visualize common algorithms such as sorting, searching, and pathfinding.
Designed and implemented visualizations using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, ensuring user-friendly interaction and dynamic updates.
Supported educational purposes by enabling users to step through algorithm execution to understand underlying logic and behavior.
Utilized DOM manipulation and asynchronous programming for real-time visualization and responsiveness.
Focused on performance optimization to handle complex algorithms and larger datasets efficiently.
Project aimed to enhance understanding of algorithmic concepts through visual and interactive learning tools.
